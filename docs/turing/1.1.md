## Introduction
CAIP uses the Turing programming language. It is a Pascal-like interpreted programming language and was mostly used in high schools in Canada.
*For more information about Turing, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)).*

It is easy to customise CAIP. No programming knowledge is required to customise the program.

## Configuration File Layout

The configuration file can be customized to your liking. This file is named **{{ page.config_file }}**.
It is a simple list, with options separated by a new line.
I recommend using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to edit the configuration file.

**DO NOT CHANGE any names before the "=" in the configuration file.**

| Line Number | Name             | Possible Entries                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Custom Name      | Anything in a **string** variable type. Use "_" to denote spaces in your custom name. |
| 2           | FG (Text) Colour | Any number ID in the colour chart below.                                              |
| 3           | BG Colour        | Any number ID in the colour chart below.                                              |
| 4           | execType         | 0 or 1, where 0 is a local file, and 1 is a URI.                                      |
| 5           | execName         | Local File (With file extension in the entry), or URI (http(s)://, steam://, etc.)    |

# Configuring Launch Settings

## Changing the program name of CAIP

To change and customize the name of your program, enter your title in the first line (customName) of the *{{ page.config_file }}* file.
Anything is allowed as the first line is mostly treated as a **string** type variable.
Use "_" (An underscore) to denote the placement of spaces in your program name entry.

## Changing the text and background colours

<table style="width:20%">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><b>Colours</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>White</td>
		<td>Black</td>
		<td>Light Grey</td>
		<td>Dark Grey</td>
	</tr>
</table>

To change the text colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the second line of the configuration file.
To change the background colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the third line of the configuration file.

## Changing the executed file / URI

The **fourth** line will determine what CAIP will display in the output window. CAIP can execute a program, multimedia file, or uniform resource identifier (URI).
It is recommended that you set this line to **0** if it is a local file, or **1** if it is an URI.
CAIP 1.1 will not work if this line is set incorrectly.

To change what will get executed in CAIP just enter the file name/URI in the fifth line of the configuration file.
If a local file is in a sub-directory, follow the guide below.

> Let's say you want to launch the *docs.html* file from the CAIP directory.
> ```CAIP 1.1/docs/docs.html```
> 
> You would enter in the **fourth** line of your **{{ page.config_file }}** file:
> ```"docs/docs.html"```
> 
> The file would be entered in this format: 
> ```sub-directory/sub-directory/filename.extension```
