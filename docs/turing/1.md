## Introduction
CAIP uses the Turing programming language. It is a Pascal-like interpreted programming language and was mostly used in high schools in Canada.
*For more information about Turing, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)).*

It is easy to customise CAIP. No programming knowledge is required to customise the program.

## Settings File Layout
The settings file can be customized to your liking. The settings file is called **{{ config_file }}**.
The settings file is a simple 1 Dimensional array, otherwise known as a "list".
I recommend using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to edit the **{{ config_file }}** file.
**DO NOT CHANGE any names before the "=" in the configuration file.**

<table style="width:30%">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Line Number</b></td>
		<td><b>Name</b></td>
		<td><b>Possible Entries</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Custom Name</td>
		<td>Anything in a <b>string</b> variable type. Use "_" to denote spaces in your custom name.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>FG (Text) Colour</td>
		<td>Any number ID in the colour chart below.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>BG Colour</td>
		<td>Any number ID in the colour chart below.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>execType</td>
		<td>0 or 1, where 0 is a local file and 1 is a web</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>5</td>
		<td>execName</td>
		<td>Local File (With file extension in the entry) or URI (http(s)://, steam://, etc.)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

# Changing Settings

## Changing the title of CAIP
To change and customize the title of CAIP, enter your title in the first line of the **{{ config_file }}** file.
Anything is allowed as the first line is mostly treated as a **string** type variable.
Use "_" to denote the placement of spaces in your custom name entry.

## Changing the text and background colours
<table style="width:20%">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><b>Colours</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>White</td>
		<td>Black</td>
		<td>Light Grey</td>
		<td>Dark Grey</td>
	</tr>
</table>

To change the text colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the second line of the **{{ config_file }}** file.
To change the background colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the third line of the **{{ config_file }}** file.

## Changing the executed file / URI
To change the file that CAIP will executed, go into the **{{ config_file }}** file.
The **fourth** line will determine what CAIP will display in the output window. CAIP can execute a program, multimedia file or URI.
It is recommended that you set this line to **0** if it is a local file, or **1** if it is a web
CAIP will not work if this line is set incorrectly.

To change what will get executed in CAIP just enter the file name in the fifth line of the **{{ config_file }}**
If your file is in a sub-directory, follow the guide below.

Let's say you want to launch the **docs.html** file from the CAIP directory.
```CAIP 1.1/docs/docs.html```

You would enter in the **fifth** line of your **{{ config_file }}** file:
```"docs/docs.html"```

The file would be entered in this format: 
```sub-directory/sub-directory/filename.extension```
