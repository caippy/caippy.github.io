<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>CAIP uses the Turing programming language. It is a Pascal-like interpreted programming language and was mostly used in high schools in Canada.
<em>For more information about Turing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language">click here</a>).</em></p>

<hr>

It is easy to customise CAIP. No programming knowledge is required to customise the program.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-file-layout">Configuration File Layout</h2>

<p>The configuration file can be customized to your liking. This file is named <strong>config.CAIP11</strong>.
It is a simple list, with options separated by a new line.
I recommend using <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> to edit the configuration file.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT CHANGE any names before the "=" in the configuration file.</strong></p>

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Line Number</th>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Possible Entries</th>

	<tbody>

<h2 id="changing-the-program-name-of-caip">Changing the program name of CAIP</h2>

<p>To change and customize the name of your program, enter your title in the first line (customName) of the <em>config.CAIP11</em> file.
Anything is allowed as the first line is mostly treated as a <strong>string</strong> type variable.
Use "_" (An underscore) to denote the placement of spaces in your program name entry.</p>

<h2 id="changing-the-text-and-background-colours">Changing the text and background colours</h2>

<table style="width:20%">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><b>Colours</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>White</td>
		<td>Black</td>
		<td>Light Grey</td>
		<td>Dark Grey</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>To change the text colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the second line of the configuration file.
To change the background colour for CAIP, enter a number corresponding to the colour you want in the third line of the configuration file.</p>

<h2 id="changing-the-executed-file-uri">Changing the executed file / URI</h2>

<p>The <strong>fourth</strong> line will determine what CAIP will display in the output window. CAIP can execute a program, multimedia file, or uniform resource identifier (URI).
It is recommended that you set this line to <strong>0</strong> if it is a local file, or <strong>1</strong> if it is an URI.
CAIP 1.1 will not work if this line is set incorrectly.</p>
<p>To change what will get executed in CAIP just enter the file name/URI in the fifth line of the configuration file.
If a local file is in a sub-directory, follow the guide below.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Let's say you want to launch the <em>docs.html</em> file from the CAIP directory.

	<code>CAIP 1.1/docs/docs.html</code></p>

	<p>You would enter in the <strong>fourth</strong> line of your <strong>config.CAIP11</strong> file:

	<code>"docs/docs.html"</code></p>

	<p>The file would be entered in this format: 

	<code>sub-directory/sub-directory/filename.extension</code></p>
</blockquote>
